<h1>Hey!</h1>
I am content included from an external file.
I need webpack to load me.

React doesn't like external HTML so much, so i am wrapped in a container with
<i>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</i>, like this:
<pre><xmp>
import includedContent from './some/html/file.html'
<div
	dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
		__html: includedContent
	}}
/>
</xmp></pre>
This example uses <strong>html-loader</strong> plugin for webpack.
