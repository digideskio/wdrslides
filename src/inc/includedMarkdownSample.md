Markdown Support
================

Okay, this is actually a cheat since webpack is doing all the heavy lifting.
Technically this is pretty much the same example as with external html. The main
difference between the last example and this one is:

 - it
 - uses
 - **markdown-loader** instead of _html-loader_

<sub>On a private note:
This is the main reason I wrote the whole thing. I wanted a modular presentation
framework that allows smooth integration in webpack projects.</sub>
